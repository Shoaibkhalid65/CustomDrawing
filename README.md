# ðŸŽ¨ Jetpack Compose Custom Drawing & Charts

This repository demonstrates **custom drawing in Jetpack Compose** using Canvas, Path, and other graphics APIs. It also showcases how to build **custom shapes, UI components, and charts** (BarChart, LineChart, etc.), along with an example integration of a **3rd-party chart library**.

The goal of this repo is to serve as a **learning resource** and **reference** for developers exploring Jetpack Compose graphics, animations, and data visualization.
